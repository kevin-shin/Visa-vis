# Visa-vis

Optional Practice Training (OPT) is a benefit for students in F-1 visa status that allows them to apply for employment authorization following their graduation. The "application" refers to the process of applying for OPT approval.

The OPT application can seem like a long and complicated process, because it may require a long time to research and collect the necessary information, and this is particularly hard to do with the pressures of senior year projects and finding a job. Additionally, the OPT application is hard to organize with currently existing productivity apps, because they do not support such a deadline sensitive process, and importing all the necessary information into the platform can be a challenge in and of itself. 

Our goal when developing Visa-vis was to provide a sensible, easy-to-use UI and ease the task of completing this process. Combining the features of a To-Do app, but prepopulated with tabs describing each task and providing helpful links to external resources, Visa-vis seeks to make completing the OPT process as easy as possible, maximizing the user's visibility into the steps of the process, all its requirements and deadlines, and resources to help when required. 

This application was submitted as the final project for Human Computer Interaction, and as such we conducted many user tests to strike at the right design. Read about our design process on our product's website: [Visa-vis](https://francisv6.wixsite.com/visa-vis).
